                    Nanoparticles are a technology that ranges in size from 1 nanometer to 100 nanometer. They act as capsules that contain drugs and will be opened at certain points in the body to release these drugs. They can also carry mRNA and DNA therapeutics that have expanded half-lives when encapsulated within the nanoparticle. The nanoparticles are created in a process of slicing up particles again and again until you get something small enough. These nanoparticles help to get the drug to places that would otherwise be impossible to get to.

                            Nanoparticles are a vital tool for identifying diagnostics, prognostic markers, as well as being able to detect tumors in the body, and being able to test different therapeutics for other diseases. Nanoparticles are able to transmit types of drugs to places in the body not normaly possible to get to

                            Due to our little knowledge on them, we still haven't found a way to use nanoparticles without risks. Nanoparticles can damage normal cells in the body as well as cancer cells. While we have been using nanoparticles much more than in the past, the amount of successful procedures has not increased much.

                <p> 
                    Since nanoparticles are carriers for other drugs to help them get to the desired place in the body, they themselves are not necessarily effective on any type of cancer. But the drugs that have been approved to be delivered using nanoparticles are Doxil and Abraxane. Doxil is most often used for ovarian cancer and AIDS. Abraxane is a chemotherapy drug used for breast and lung cancer.

                    Nanoparticles are a capsule for other cancer drugs and will need to work alongside them to help fight cancer. If all you sent in were the nanoparticles nothing would happen as there would be no drug to be administered

                    While nanoparticles have shown great promise in fighting cancer, they do have risks. Inhaled nanoparticles may result in lung inflammation and heart problems. Nanoparticles can also be toxic to the brain and cause cardiac issues and problems.

                    Throughout the years, nanoparticles have become a more popular theory in a way to stop cancer. However, while this option has been tried and tested, we donâ€™t know enough about them to use them without potentially hurting the body. Scientists originally started researching this potential way to fight cancer in the 1980s, progress has been slow, but helpful, as we have made significant progress in studies to use nanoparticles.
